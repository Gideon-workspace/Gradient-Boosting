# Student Classification using Gradient Boosting

![Student Classification](path/to/your/image.png)

## Overview
This project leverages **Gradient Boosting**, a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm, to classify students based on their **exam scores** and **attendance percentages**. The model predicts the type of student, enabling educators and administrators to better understand student performance patterns.

## Features
- Predicts student categories using academic performance and attendance data.
- Employs Gradient Boosting for high accuracy and robust performance.
- Provides insights that can help identify students who may need additional support.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Exam Scores:** Numeric values representing student performance in exams.
- **Attendance Percentages:** Numeric values representing class attendance rates.

## Model
- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Objective:** Classify students into different types based on performance and engagement.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and F1-score.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-classification.git
